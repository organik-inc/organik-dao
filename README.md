Created at ethglobal Hackathon 2022 - Feb 4th

Hi! Welcome to the first final commit for Organik DAO.

This is a project built for the ETH Global Polygon Hackathon.

I'm very happy to have attended most of the webinars/masterclasses from every one in this space.
Special thanks to everyother noob like me that pushed me to keep trying and never give up.

### How it works?

[OrganikDAO Contract](./contracts/OrganikDAO.sol)

First we created this smart contract.

It's a Funding DAO built on Polygon.

Some of the main features:

- Donate to Treasury
> Donate >$50 MATIC = Become a Sponsor.
> 
> $20 MATIC = Become a Club Member.
> 
> or <$20 MATIC = Become a Farmer Member.

- Submit a Project to the community
> Add a Name, Description and a Link for more information.
> 
> Request up to 1M MATIC to fund your project.
> 
> Wait for approval from our Sponsors (24 hours).
> 
> Once your project is approved and fully funded, you will receive MATIC in your Account.

- Sponsors:
> This is a funding DAO not a lending DAO, which means all proposals are funded and based in trust.
> 
> Sponsors will get an Organik Token for every MATIC they use to fund projects.
> 
> Sponsors will be able to trade this Tokens freely within the community.

- Trading Organik Tokens with Members and Farmers
> Sponsors will be able to:
> 
> Trade this Tokens for free food or anything the Farmers can provide,
> 
> Access to educational Permaculture Events at the Farms,
> 
> Book a night experience at the Farms. (Permaculture Centers)
